# role a still-deleting region's stack depends on. They are therefore withheld
# from the per-region sweeps and reaped once, after every region finishes stack
# deletion and only when no stack survives anywhere
# (see ``CleanupManager._sweep_global_leftovers``).
#
# This is the single canonical set, shared with the reset path

# name — blanket-listing it would misclassify every regional WAF as global.
