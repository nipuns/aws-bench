# attempts (~49s) on the broken-handler types (AWS::ControlTower::EnabledBaseline, ...), which
# fail identically every time — pure waste on every cleanup sweep wave. Botocore's retry
# conditions cannot exclude a single error code, so instead of letting it retry everything, the
# existence check re-adds retries at the application level (``resource_exists``, tenacity) for the
# RECOVERABLE classes only — throttles and transient 5xx/connection faults — while a broken-handler
# fault short-circuits on the first attempt. That keeps the reset/verification callers resilient to

# execution role) can be deleted by a region that has no such dependent while
# another region is still tearing the dependent down, wedging that delete. These
# types are therefore deleted once, in a final account-level pass, after every
# region's resource deletion has completed. See reset.manager and cleanup.manager
